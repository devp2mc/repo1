## Contributions:
Both group members worked together on the assignment during our lab session and contributed equally to the project. In particular, Partik Dev focused on constructing and analyzing the calculations for the elapsed time using `jiffies` and `HZ`. Additionally, Partik created and organized comments for the program, ensuring readability. Gurman Johal lead constructing the module and coding the program files. Gurman tested and compiled the files in the Linux environment using kernel commands. Both group members tested the program and contributed equally to the assignment, working together throughout the lab.
