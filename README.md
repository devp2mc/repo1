## Program Explanation:
The program we have designed is a Memory Management Simulator which simulates the process of translating logical addresses into physical addresses using paging system, TLB, and  page fault handling. The program uses the `addresses.txt` as its logical adresses.

## Contributions:
Both group members contributed equally to the project and collaborated effectively through discussions and coding sessions. However, each member focused on specific areas of the project.

**Partik Dev**: Partik focused on constructing the overall process and logic for the the memory management system. This would include designing the address translation process, the TLB cache implementation, and handling page faults. Partik also focused on managing memory allocation and pointers for the file while ensuring that the program properly follows a  FIFO page replacement design. Addtionally, he defined and constructed the functions for address translation and TLB management with proper synchronization between the page table and operations. 

**Gurmandeep Jhoal**: Gurmandeep heavily focused on implementing the overall program structure and ensuring that the code works altogther in smooth continous fashion. Gurmandeep also was resposnible for setting up the main function and having everthing operate with it. This means he would create the reading systen for the input from `addresses.txt`, and manage the memory operations related to page faults. Gurmandeep also made it so that the output is more user-friendly by formatting the results with clarity. overall, Gurman ensured that each part would be implemented correctly and run smoothly altoghther. 

Both group members worked together on debugging and testing the program to ensure that it worked efficiently.
