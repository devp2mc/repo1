# Assignment 4

## Group Members:
- **Partik Dev**
- **Gurmandeep Johal*

## Student ID:
- **Partik Dev: 400478418** 
- **Gurmandeep Johal: 400467941** 

## Sorting Algorithm:
We used the built in `qsort()` function from the C library. Along with the function we used a compare function to help compare values.

## Contributions:
Both group members contributed equally to the project and collaborated effectively through discussions and coding sessions. However, each member focused on specific areas of the project.

**Partik Dev**: Partik focused on constructing the overall process and logic for each of the disk scheduling algorithms. Partik would design how the algorithm for each method would work by running through test samples of how the code should work. Intially created Psudocode that would be used as a basis for the final program. Partik also contributied in defining the function, variables that would be need for the program such as the sorting algorithm. 

**Gurmandeep Jhoal**: Gurmandeep heavily focused on implementing the overall program structure and ensuring that the code works altogther in smooth continous fashion. Gurmandeep ensured that the intial designs created by Partik would be implemented correctly in the C file. Gumrman also contributed in running and testing the code to ensure that the desired output of the functions would occur correctly for both the left and right directions. 

Both group members worked together on debugging and testing the program to ensure that it worked efficiently.
