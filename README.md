# Assignment 1

## Name:
**Partik Dev**

## Student ID:
**devp2: 400478418** 

## Files Submitted:
- **devp2_part1.py** (Linear Regression model that plots and compares GDP and Happiness)
- **devp2_part2.py** (Polynomial Regression model that plots and compares several features with the age)

**Note:** In both files the code does expect the dataset files "gd-vs-hapiness.csv" and "training_data.csv"  

## How to Run
- **Step 1:** Have atleast Python 3 and these packages "pnadas", "numpy", "matplotlib", and "seaborn" installed.
- **Step 2:** Ensure you have the files, in the folder "datasets", "gd-vs-hapiness.csv" and "training_data.csv". This folder needs to be in the same directory as the Python scripts.
- **Step 3:** In terminal ensure that you are in the correct directory. This can be done by using the "cd" command. After being in the correct directory, you run each script respectively "python yourmacid_part1.py" (part 1) and "python yourmacid_part2.py" (part 2).

## Generative AI Usage Disclosure
- Model: ChatGPT (GPT-5 mini)
- Usage: Used Chat GPT to help understand the conecpt of polynomial and linear regression in code. Used primarily for help setting up plotting of graphs and how they would look like with each of the seven features. To further add on, used to help understand how I could represent data visually through the helper class. Majority of support came through understanding the part 2 of the assignment most affectivly in "devp2_part2.py".

- Time used: ~30 minutes 
- Estimated CO2 emissions: ~216 g CO2 (Using the CO2 emissions cacualtor provided and that fact that ChatGPT estimates are 4.32g CO2, I looked back at roughly the amount of queries I had (50) and caculated the amount of emissions it would produce per.
