## Contributions:
Both group members worked together on the assignment during our lab session and contributed equally to the project. In particular, Partik Dev focused on constructing and analyzing the calculations for the elapsed time using `jiffies` and `HZ`. Additionally, Partik created and organized comments for the program, ensuring readability. 
Gurmandeep Johal lead the construction of the module and the coding of the program files. Gurmandeep tested and executed the files in the Linux environment using kernel commands. Both group members tested the program and contributed equally to the assignment, working together throughout the lab.
